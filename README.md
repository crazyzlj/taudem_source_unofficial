This repository is used for tracking the latest updates of TauDEM release version from the [official repository](https://github.com/dtarb/TauDEM/releases).

We have started a repository [TauDEM_ext](https://github.com/lreis2415/TauDEM_ext) based on the parallelized framework of TauDEM, which is aimed to extending digital terrain analysis algorithms.

So, some minor modification may be made.

This repository is just used for tracking the latest updates of the offical TauDEM.
